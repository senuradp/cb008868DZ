                    decline in its prey species, along with poaching and environment misfortune, has caused

                    damage. This feline may before long be terminated in nature. </p>
                <p> The Sri Lankan leopard is the most clandestine and enigmatic of the enormous carnivores, and
                    furthermore the most cunning as well.
                    It is the most fastest and heftiest climber of the bigger felines and is capable of capturing
                    prey
                    far bigger than itself. </p>
                <p> The Sri Lankan leopard also known as <strong>"DIVIYA"</strong> is an endangered species and
                    naturally found in hill country
                    areas and
                    isolated forests.

                <p> Macaws are enormous individuals from the parrot family found all through Central and South
                    America.
                    Their brilliant shadings and uproarious vocalizations are significant devices for correspondence
                    Blue-and-yellow macaws, in the same way as other different parrots, mate with only one parrot
                    for a
                    period of time. </p>
                <!-- <p> They arrive at sexual development around 3 to 4 years old and breed occasionally depending on their
                    area. Sets will settle in tree hollows or pits that are high up in trees.Youthful are self-sustained
                    around after a quarter of a year, however before then the two guardians are engaged with raising the
                    hatchlings, which are brought into the world without feathers and are amazingly powerless against
                    predation.</p> -->
                <p> In the same way as other parrots, macaws are seemingly perpetual, some of the time as long as 50
                    years even though , generally they have a life expectancy of 30-45 years. Macaws are usually
                    found
                    in the pet exchange.

                <p>The giant panda is natively from the thick bamboo forests in Sourth Central China. These reserved
                    creatures are generally excellent tree climbers and awesome swimmers.A panda generally eats
                    while
                    sitting upstanding, in a represent that looks like
                    how people sit on the floor. This stance leaves the forepaws allowed to get a handle on bamboo
                    stems
                    with the assistance of a "pseudo thumb," shaped by an extended and expanded wrist bone covered
                    with
                    a plump cushion of skin.</p>
                <p>The panda additionally utilizes its incredible jaws and solid teeth to
                    pulverize the extreme, sinewy bamboo into bits. </p>
                <p><strong>Did you know ?</strong></p>
                <p> -Periodically they eat other vegetation, fish, or little creatures, yet bamboo

                <font>Giraffe </font>
                <p> The giraffe is the tallest creature on Earth. A male giraffe towers up to nineteen feet over the
                    ground. Giraffes live in eastern, focal and southern Africa. They range across savannah,
                    prairies,
                    and open woods looking for trees – particularly their top choice, acacias – to take care of
                    upon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Giraffes burn through most of their energy and time by eating. Their amazing stature grants them
                    to
                    examine on leaves that other plant eaters are unable to reach. Giraffes twist their long, dim
                    tongues encircling the leaves or new shoots in the upper pieces of trees and maneuver them into
                    their mouths. They moreover scrutinize on leaves closer to the ground and may similarly eat
                    verdant
                    food varieties, soil that is ample in minerals. A giraffe can eat far in excess of 100 pounds of
                    food every day.

                <font>Gorilla </font>
                <p> Gorillas are fundamentally herbivorous, eating the leaves and stems of spices, bushes and
                    plants.
                    They likewise eat the plump products of near 100 occasionally fruiting tree species. Other
                    gorilla
                    subspecies eat relatively less natural product. Gorillas get some protein from spineless
                    creatures
                    found on leaves and natural products. Grown-up male gorillas eat around 32 kg of food each day.
                    Females eat around 66% of that sum.</p>
                <p>
                    Gorillas are entirely covered with slender, short , dark grey to dark brown hair apart from
                    their
                    face. A little white tuft of hair on their back end helps their parents to recognize their
                    newborn
                    children as long as four years of age. The white fix helps the mother monitor the baby and helps
                    other gathering individuals in recognizing the gorilla as a newborn child.
